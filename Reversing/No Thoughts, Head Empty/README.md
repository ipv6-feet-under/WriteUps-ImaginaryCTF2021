### Description

```
When I was making Roolang, of course I took a look at the mother of all esolangs! So, have some bf code. Run it here (https://copy.sh/brainfuck/) with 32 bit cells and dynamic memory enabled. Run the program to get the flag, and then some.

The numbers on the tape are the decimals for the flag. if you run out of memore just delete some from the start and rerun it.
