### Description

```
I made a spelling test for you, but with a twist. There are several words in words.txt that are misspelled by one letter only. Find the misspelled words, fix them, and find the letter that I changed. Put the changed letters together, and you get the flag. Make sure to insert the "{}" into the flag where it meets the format.

NOTE: the words are spelled in American English
