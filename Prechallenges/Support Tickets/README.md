### Description

```
Do you need help on a hard challenge? Don't worry, our mod team is here to help you. If at any time you have technical difficulties or clarification on a challenge, or reporting a bug/issue, you have two options: either make a support ticket (recommended), or press the green chat icon in the bottom right, and someone will help you there. To create a support ticket, go to our Discord server and go to the #support-ticket channel. Then press on an icon that best suits your needs.
